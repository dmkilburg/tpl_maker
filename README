tpl_maker.py created by Denise M Kilburg for the Gunner Lab at
CUNY-City College for the generation of ligand topology files for use in
MCCE.

tpl_maker.py requires a protein data bank file, ligand code, chain id, and
charge.  For example:

tpl_maker.py 4Q6T.pdb PO4 A -3

At the moment, the charge represents the most negative charge on an ion
and it dictates the amount of conformers made. For example: in the above
PO4 example, charge = -3 will create a PO401(neutral conformer), PO4-1,
PO4-2,PO4-3 conformers. At the moment, the charge also specifies the
number of hydrogens to be removed from the neutral conformer.  At present,
the program removes hydrogens from hydroxyl groups. If there are no
hydroxyl groups it will remove hydrogens starting from H1, H2,...
The add_hydrogens function adds hydrogens in 2 ways. If an atom is connected
to 2 or more atoms, it looks at the angles that subtend them and assigns
orbitals based on geometry:

sp3 == tetrahedral, sp2 == trigonal planar, sp == linear.

It then adds the proper number of hydrogen atoms to fit the geometry. 
If an atom only has one connection (terminal), it calculates bond distance
and looks for that bond distance in the bond_table and assigns a hybridization
based on geometry.
